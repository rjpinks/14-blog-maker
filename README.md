# Tech Blog

## Description

I tried to build a blog, so that I would get experience using sequelize and a SQL-style database. With this app, people could communicate with eachother about tech. I learned a lot about creating a full stack application. I also learned a lot about using handlebars, which is a challenge in-of-itself because some of it's application was not very intuitive. Additionally, I learned about data models as I adjusted mine throughout the project.

Unfortunately, I could not get the app to run the way I desired. I could not get sessions to work, so the logging in feature is bugged. I found a lot of difficulties trying to get this app to work, and my struggles taught me a lot. It forced me to look at a lot of reference material. Despite not being as successful as I wish, it was still a valuable learning experience.


## Installation

Express-sessions, express-handlebars, express, dotenv, bcrypt for password hashing, mysql, and sequelize are the necessairy packages for the app to run. Additionally, nodemon was used in the development.

## Usage

On entrance to the website, you can see a multitude of people's posts. If you click the dashboard button, you can either create a post or create an account. Alternatively, you can click login to login if you already have an account.

Unfortunately, I cannot test some aspects of my app because I cannot get the login feature to work. However, the routes work in Postman.

## Credits

The app in week 14's student mini project in the curriculum was absolutely essential for the production of this app. I leaned heavily as a reference to almost every aspect of this code.
